TASK:

1. Suggest an autocoder and train it with training data from the built-in it minst database (omitting labels),
2. Remove the last layers of the autocoder, leaving only the encoder, 
3. Calculate the encoder response and generate the code for the input data, 
4. Use K-means analysis to determine the data clusters for your code. You can analyze the correct number of groups, 
5. For 10 clusters (10 digits) label the input data, 
6. Compare your results with the original label
